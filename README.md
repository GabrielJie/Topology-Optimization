# Topology-Optimization
Topology optimization based on the Moving Node Algorithm using EFG, FEM or IIEFG methods.

## Main file
The main file topologyOptimization.m is a Matlab script that launches the optimizers. The user can change the script to set
* The discretization method (EFG or FEM)
* The optimization variables (mass nodes, undeformable structural members or deformable structural members)
* The optimization algorithm
